CREDIT CARD FAULT DETECTION 

In today's digital age, credit card fraud has become a significant threat, impacting millions globally. To combat this menace, I am excited to share that I have been working on a sophisticated Credit Card Fraud Detection System using advanced machine learning techniques. üåü

üîç Why is Credit Card Fraud Detection Important?
Credit card fraud can cause substantial financial losses and damage to consumer trust. Detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions is crucial to safeguarding both financial institutions and consumers from potential risks.

üí° Our Approach:
Utilizing a blend of supervised machine learning algorithms and historical transaction data, our system is designed to accurately identify and flag suspicious activities. Here's a sneak peek into our approach:

Data Collection: Gathered extensive datasets containing historical transaction records and labeled fraudulent activities.
Feature Engineering: Extracted key features such as transaction amount, frequency, location, and time to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Training: Leveraged algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to train our model.
Evaluation: Rigorously tested the model for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance.
Deployment: Implemented the model in a Flask web application, providing real-time fraud detection capabilities.
